  section
    h1 Modules Cont.

  section
    p A module is a collection of configuration and run blocks which get applied to the application during the bootstrap process.

  section
    p In its simplest form, the module consists of two kinds of blocks.

  section
    h2 Configuration Blocks

  section
    p
      | Configuration blocks get executed during the provider registrations and configuration phase.
      | Only providers and constants can be injected into configuration blocks. This is to prevent accidental instantiation
      | of services before they have been fully configured.

  section
    p Angular provides convience methods for module configuration that are equivalent to the config block.

  section
    h2 Run Blocks

  section
    p
      | Run blocks get executed after the injector is created and are used to kickstart the application.
      | Only instances and constants can be injected into run blocks. This is to prevent further system configuration
      | during application run time.

  section
    p Run blocks are the closest thing in Angular to the main method.

  section
    p A run block is the code which needs to run to kickstart the application.
    p It is executed after all of the service have been configured and the injector has been created.

  section
    p Example of run and config.

  section
    h2 Inheritance

  section
    p It is common to attach controllers at different levels of the DOM hierarchy.

  section
    p Since the ng-controller directive creates a new child scope, we get a hierarchy of scopes that inherit from each other.

  section
    p The $scope that each Controller receives will have access to properties and methods defined by controllers higher up the hierarchy.

  section
    p What would the value of property be for each controller?
